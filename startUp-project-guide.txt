Welcome to the Laravel Project for MHRA!
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local environment:

1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the repository using:

git clone https://git.brainster.co/Despina.Milanovska-FS15/brainsterprojects_despina-milanovskafs15.git .
cd mhra

2. Install Composer Dependencies
Make sure you have Composer installed. Run the following command to install the PHP dependencies:

composer install

3. Install NPM Packages
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the dependencies:

npm install

4. Copy the Environment File
Create a copy of the .env.example file to .env:

cp .env.example .env

5. Generate Application Key
Generate a unique application key for your Laravel project:

php artisan key:generate

6. Run Migrations and Seeders
Run the project migrations and seeders in one command:

php artisan migrate --seed

7. Create a Storage Link
To make the storage folder accessible from the web, create a symbolic link:

php artisan storage:link

NOTE: If the storage link fails or bugs occur, remove the link and generate it again:

# Remove the existing symbolic link
rm public/storage

# Recreate the symbolic link
php artisan storage:link

8. Start the Development Server
Start the Laravel development server using:

php artisan serve

9. Start Vite Environment
Start the Vite development server to enable working with CSS and JS assets:

npm run dev

In this Laravel project, I've utilized Laravel Breeze for simple authentication, paired with Vite for efficient asset management. 
For interactivity, Alpine.js provides lightweight JavaScript components. The Commentify package implements a robust comment system, 
while Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling. The Trix editor serves as a rich text editor for embedding HTML content, and Livewire enables dynamic, 
reactive components without leaving the comfort of Laravel.
